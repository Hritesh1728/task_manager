I used `Angular`, `Angular Bootstrap`, `ng-apexcharts`, `bootstrap`,`HTML5`, `CSS3`,`JavaScript`,`Browser Properties`, `Font Awesome`,`Google fonts` and many more.

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
